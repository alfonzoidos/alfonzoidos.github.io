# Alfonzo Idos Portfolio
Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! 

I am a Junior Data Analyst with 2 years of experience in data flows, process mapping, data modeling, and visualization. I‚Äôve worked on projects that improved data accessibility and integrity, including building dashboards and reviving a project that had been stalled for over a year by delivering a solution within 2 weeks.

My experience includes Python for data analysis, sustainability analytics (such as computing carbon emissions and creating dashboards for it), and exploring AI use cases like test-driven development and chatbot initiatives. I‚Äôve also supported stakeholders through documentation, presentations, and solution recommendations.

I‚Äôm currently expanding my expertise in SQL, Python, AI, and data engineering tools to build scalable data pipelines and enhance data infrastructure, looking forward to applying these in practical projects. I‚Äôm passionate about learning, problem-solving, and collaborating to create impactful, data-driven solutions.
